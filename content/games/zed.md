_Revelation, regret and redemption in the twilight dreams of an aging artist._

Set against surreal landscapes spanning one manâ€™s life and career, ZED is a desperate quest to reconnect fading memories
 and create a final work for a very special person.

Help reconnect fading memories in Linux! This native port brings both the standard and VR experience from Myst artist 
Chuck Carter to the Linux Desktop. It was a real privilege to meet Chuck and work with Cyan to build and test the port.
