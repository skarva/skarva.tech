SKÄRVA is a small, independent group with a non-stop desire to design, create, or enhance in many realms;
    Linux, web, games, and photography. Constantly pushing to learn more and better their skills, the group 
    is always open to discuss taking on contract work in addition to pursuing their own ideas and projects.

SKÄRVA also takes great pride in sharing knowledge and supporting open source software; using it first and
    foremost when possible, and even contribute and advocate how they can. Their preferred distribution is 
    [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io).
